Description: helper script for Tahoe-LAFS
 grid-updates attempts to keep Tahoe-LAFS nodes' configurations up-to-date and
 thereby Tahoe grids as well connected as possible.  It can download lists of
 introducers and display news feeds for grid-related news.
 .
 On some public grids all nodes, even introducers, are run by volunteers and
 may disappear at any given time.  Maintaining a list of all known introducers
 and distributing it to all participants of the grid will decrease the
 possibility that the grid will get disconnected.
