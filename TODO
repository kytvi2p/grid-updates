These are suggestions:

TODO
	* Check if code, documentation, error strings etc. can still be less I2P specific
	  (e.g. eep_get()).
	* Fix convoluted eepget code (assume everybody has upgraded)
	* Include HTML docs?
	* Neatly list all dependencies?
	* BSD compatibility

UNDECIDED
	* Support web UI patches for multiple versions of Tahoe?
	* Test on Windows?
	* Download script updates from HTTP URIs?
	* Don't hardcode links to http://127.0.0.1:3456/static/NEWS.html; parse tahoe.cfg
