Setup notes for grid-updates
============================

See `README\.txt`_  and the `man page`_
for more information about grid-updates.

Requirements
------------

Python version 2.6 and later. Python is not a requirement for Windows users.

Installation
------------

Users with an available Python installation can install grid-updates
with the command ``python setup.py install`` from within the source
archive.

Debian users can build packages with the command
``fakeroot debian/rules binary``. This will build a package that can be
installed using ``dpkg``. This package will include the script and its
documentation.

Windows users have the following available options:

-  Binary installer for use on systems without Python
-  Installer for systems with Python
-  Installation from the source archive (``python setup.py install`` as
   above)

Consider running ``grid-updates --patch-tahoe`` after installation.  This will
apply a small patch to Tahoe-LAFS's web console to allow displaying news from
grid-update's in an Iframe. The web console can be restored to its original
state with ``grid-updates --undo-tahoe-patch``.

Permissions
-----------

In order for this script to work, it needs to have read and write permission
for the Tahoe-LAFS node's directory. This directory is typically located at
``%appdata%\.tahoe`` for Windows users and ``~/.tahoe`` for other systems.

If asked to, ``grid-updates`` will update your introducers file and make a
backup of it. When fetching NEWS, the script will write a plain text version to
``~/.tahoe/NEWS``.  Additionally, an HTML version and an Atom news feed will be
saved to your Tahoe node's ``web.static`` directory (typically
``~/.tahoe/public_html``). NEWS.html and NEWS.atom can be viewed in the node's
`/static`_ directory, or (having patched Tahoe's Web UI) right on your node's
`front page`_
